# Kafka notes

Here are some configuration properties to remind.

## Producer

```
bootstrap.servers=broker1:9091,broker2:9091
```

**Required** A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. Then the producer will discover the all kafka cluster so it is not necessary to put the full list of kafka brokers in this property. Put just one more in case of failure.

```
acks=all
```

**Optional** The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. *acks=all* means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. Default value is *1* meaning the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers.

```
client.id="my-application"
```

An id string to pass to the server when making requests. Allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging. If there are several instances of the same application it may be a good idea to append the instance id after the application name. E.g. "my-application-1" or "my-application-2".

```
enable.idempotence=true
```

Enable the exactly-once delivery semantic.

## Consumer
